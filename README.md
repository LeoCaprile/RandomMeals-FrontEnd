# Random Meals!
Hi ðŸ¤“, Welcome to the first fullstack app i'd created!

# What the app does?

Random Meals it's an app where you can find random meals and save onto your account!. 
You can see their recipe or a tutorial on how to make the dish on youtube.

# How it's created?

## Frontend

 - HTML5
 - Bulma framework
 - CSS3
 - VanillaJS


## Backend

 - NodeJS
 - Express

## Bundler
 - Webpack

## Deploy

 - Heroku

# How to run the app

 1. Git clone to a folder in your computer
 2. npm install, to install all the dependendies.
 3. npm start, to start the dev server.
 4. npm build, to build de dist folder.

 
It took sort of 1.5 months to get to this point on the app, it's entirely created with an FP style (i think).
